This corrected version removes the use of `unsafePerformIO` and uses pure functional techniques to achieve the same (or similar) result.  This ensures predictable behavior and avoids non-deterministic side effects.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let myGlobal = 10  -- Initialize without side effects
  putStrLn "This side effect is now outside the variable's definition!"
  print myGlobal
  print myGlobal
```

By defining `myGlobal` directly without the side effect, the code's behavior becomes deterministic.  The side effect is now explicitly managed as a separate `putStrLn` statement, demonstrating proper separation of concerns.
